							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Hoot is an internal tool I'm really proud of. In addition to being the designer of the project, I was also the product and project manager. My roles and responsibilities indluced leading user research and usability testing, creating wireframes and mockups, contributing to front-end development, and project scoping and mapping. I got to work really closely with engineers on my team to strategize the component and functionality planning. I really enjoyed this close relationship with developers and believe the intentionally blurry lines between engineering and design helped create a more holistic and efficient product for our users.</p>
					</div></section>
					<section id="first">
						<header>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>In order to figure out what the replacement product to Synchro should be, I organzied, planned, and conducted 17 user interviews with key users and stakeholders (in this case, executive staff) to collect data on their current usage patterns, likes, painpoints, and overall needs.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I developed a process to aggregate data and find usage patterns. Using Github and Zenhub, I documented all interview findings with labels corresponding to the user, feature it relates to, and grouped these by larger question categories asked in the interviews in order to be able to filter and look at larger patterns in the data. I then documented an extensive Key Findings Report that documented these found patterns.</p>

							<h2>Wireframes</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The wireframes served as communication between myself and the engineers on the project to drive discussions on development solutions and component planning for React.js. This also helped communicate to stakeholders how and what problems the project will be solving.</p>

							<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
							<p>Once the MVP of the product was built and released, I organized and oversaw three usability tests, generating the scripts and coaching my managees on best practices and procedures.</p>
							<p>We recorded the three sessions and documented their interactions with Hoot. Using a system I created, I turned the massive amounts of qualitative feedback into quantitative in order to prioritize what the most effective use of the team's time could be. This system proved very successful, allowing me the opportunity to give a company-wide presentation on it later that month.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As users went through the site, the different problems they encountered were documented and scored based on:
								</p><ul>
									<li>frequency (1-3 because there were 3 users total)</li>
									<li>impact (how impactful was the problem on the user’s ability to complete the task, also rated 1-3)</li>
									<li>task importance (how important is the task they’re completing in relation to the end goal of the site, also rated 1-3)</li>
								</ul>
							These were multiplied together, generating the Importance to User column, showing how much of an impact each problem had on the Hoot user experience. We also rated the ease of fix from 1-3, with 3 being the easiest to fix. This was then multiplied with the Importance to User column and ordered from highest to lowest to see which order each problem should be approached in. With this model, problems that most affected the usability of the site and are easiest to fix are at the top of the list.<p></p>
