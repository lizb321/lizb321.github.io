							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>My team and I were asked to design and develop an internal tool to help teams curate articles from our database, schedule them for specific dates, and publish them. This was my first internal tool. In fact, it was also the first time that design was able to participate in the tool creation process at all, so in addition to navigating this process for the first time, I wanted to make sure that I created a strong foundation for future projects as well.</p>
							<p> Fortunately SurfShop was determined successful, and even got high praise from the CEO, Mira Wilczek, who wrote <strong>"the form & functional alignment with your user community’s needs speaks to a well-run design process (on top of the design skills you obviously have demonstrated time and again) and assumption of a huge responsibility as design owner of the project . . . SurfShop is a huge undertaking and [your manager] could not sing your praises enough as he was showing us how well the overall project has come together."</strong> Yay!</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Luckily this tool had a predecessor, so the lead engineer on the project and I could use this as a foundation for our user interviews. We conducted 8 amongst core analytic teams that would be potential new users. Once the first stab at wireframes was done, we reconnected with these users and collected more tactile feedback, leading to the final version of the wireframes.</p>
					</section>

						<header>
							<h2>Wireframes</h2>
							<p>Working on the wireframes was a fun and rewarding process. This was a much larger UX challenge than I had taken on yet, doing my best to integrate the large amount of feedback we got. I also worked closely with the lead engineer when designing these, making sure along the way that my designs would be able to be effectively implemented within our given resources. Working so closely with development was very enjoyable and definitely led to a positive final product.</p>

							<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
							<p>Once the MVP of the product was built and released, I organized and conducted three usability tests.</p>
							<p>We recorded the three sessions and documented their interactions with SurfShop. This being the first time design was involved at these stages, I implemented a feedback process that turned our qualitative data into quantitative, giving the team the ability to prioritize iterations and bug fixes in order of its impact and ease of fix on the user.</p>
							<p>These iterations and feature additions beyond MVP took us to v1.6.</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As users went through the site, the different problems they encountered were documented and scored based on:
								<ul>
									<li>frequency (1-3 because there were 3 users total)</li>
									<li>impact (how impactful was the problem on the user’s ability to complete the task, also rated 1-3)</li>
									<li>task importance (how important is the task they’re completing in relation to the end goal of the site, also rated 1-3)</li>
								</ul>
							These were multiplied together, generating the Importance to User column, showing how much of an impact each problem had on the Hoot user experience. We also rated the ease of fix from 1-3, with 3 being the easiest to fix. This was then multiplied with the Importance to User column and ordered from highest to lowest to see which order each problem should be approached in. With this model, problems that most affected the usability of the site and are easiest to fix are at the top of the list.</p>
